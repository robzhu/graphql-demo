# AngularJS Boston GraphQL demo
Welcome Boston Angularians! This repo contains everything we'll cover during the presentation. Wanna get some hands-on experience? Follow along with our live-coding demo:

## Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/robzhu/graphql-demo 
cd graphql-demo/start
```

Under the current directory, you should see two files: index.html and app.js. Open app.js in your favorite editor and open index.html in your browser (we'll be using ES6, so make sure your browser is up-to-date). 

When we start, the presenter will share a live-coding URL, which will stream changes as the presenter edits app.js. You can use this URL to follow along and copy/paste from in case you get lost.
